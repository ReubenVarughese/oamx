The primary brand color is a vivid neon green, used boldly in large blocks, buttons, and accent elements to inject energy and a futuristic feel. Black is employed extensively for text and some background blocks, creating sharp contrast and clear visual hierarchy. Typography is clean, geometric sans-serif, with large, bold headings and smaller body text that maintains clarity and approachability. The layout is modular and asymmetrical yet balanced, with generous negative space and rounded corners on content blocks to soften the overall look. Simple geometric icons and repeated radial/starburst motifs in black and gray reinforce brand identity without clutter. Buttons are minimalistic, using neon green or black backgrounds with clear outlines and text. Overall, the design communicates a confident, innovative, and tech-savvy brand personality, suitable for professional services or consultancies focused on growth and modern solutions.",

      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'primary' color predominantly for text on light backgrounds and for dark backgrounds where white text is needed, using 'primaryForeground' for contrast. The 'secondary' color serves as the main background color, with 'secondaryForeground' used for text on white backgrounds. The 'accentCyan' color is reserved for calls to action, highlights, and interactive elements to draw user attention effectively. The 'darkGrayOverlay' is used as a semi-transparent overlay behind text on images to ensure readability. Combining 'primary' and 'secondary' colors maintains a clean and professional look, while 'accentCyan' adds vibrancy and modernity. Ensure sufficient contrast between text and backgrounds for accessibility, especially when using 'accentCyan' on darker backgrounds.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primaryForeground' on 'primary' provides excellent contrast (white on black). The 'secondaryForeground' on 'secondary' also ensures high readability (black on white). The 'accentCyan' on 'primary' or 'secondary' backgrounds meets WCAG AA standards for buttons and highlights. The 'darkGrayOverlay' ensures text over images remains legible by increasing contrast. Overall, the palette supports strong accessibility compliance for text and interactive elements."

  "initialPrompt": "Create a modern, forward-looking website for OAMx (Ohio Advanced Mobility Exchange), reflecting its evolution from the Ohio UAM Symposium. The site should showcase past and future events, provide information about the 2025 event (theme, schedule, registration, sponsorship), and offer clear ways for students, industry professionals, and partners to get involved. Include pages for Home, About, 2025 Event, Get Involved, Registration & Ticketing, Mentorship Program (coming soon), and Meet the Team. The design should be responsive, integrate social media, support email sign-ups, and maintain Ohio State branding while emphasizing OAMx’s innovative identity.
